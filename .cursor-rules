# Cursor AI Rules for Software Scope Project

## Critical Safety Rules
- **NEVER run destructive commands without explicit user permission**
- **NEVER run `cargo clean` without asking first** - it deletes all build artifacts including MSI files
- **NEVER delete or modify existing MSI builds or versions** without explicit permission
- **ALWAYS check what files will be affected** before running any build or clean commands

## Build and File Management
- Always preserve existing MSI builds and versions
- Ask before running commands that could affect existing files
- Use `list_dir` to check what files exist before making changes
- When building new versions, ask if previous versions should be preserved

## Best Practices
- Always ask "Should I proceed?" before running potentially destructive commands
- Check the impact of commands before executing them
- Preserve user's work and existing builds
- Be extra careful with build artifacts and generated files

## Examples of Commands to Ask About First
- `cargo clean`
- `rm -rf` or `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`
- Any command that modifies or deletes build outputs
- Commands that could affect existing MSI files or installers
